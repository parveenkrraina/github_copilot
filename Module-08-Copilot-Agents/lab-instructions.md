# Lab 8: Agent-Based Development Workflow

**Duration:** 30 minutes

## Objectives
- Use Copilot in different agent roles
- Apply multi-agent collaboration
- Improve code through agent workflows
- Practice agent-to-agent thinking

## Exercise 1: Developer Agent (5 min)
As a developer, implement a feature:
```
"As a developer, implement a user registration system
with email validation and password hashing."
```

## Exercise 2: Reviewer Agent (5 min)
As a reviewer, critique the code:
```
"As a code reviewer, analyze this registration code for:
- Security issues
- Best practices
- Potential bugs
- Improvements"
```

## Exercise 3: Developer Response (5 min)
As a developer, address feedback:
```
"As a developer, address these review comments:
[paste feedback]"
```

## Exercise 4: QA Agent (5 min)
As QA, create test suite:
```
"As a QA engineer, create comprehensive tests 
including edge cases and security scenarios."
```

## Exercise 5: Complete Workflow (10 min)
Implement a feature using all agents:
1. Developer: Implement password reset
2. Reviewer: Review implementation
3. Developer: Fix issues
4. QA: Create tests
5. Security: Security audit
6. Documentation: Create docs

**Deliverables:**
- Code from each agent perspective
- Documentation of agent interactions
- Final refined implementation
- Complete test suite

## Key Takeaways
- Different roles provide different insights
- Multi-agent review catches more issues
- Iteration improves quality
- Agent workflows mirror real processes
